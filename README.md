### About the project

In this project, I learned how to store information in a database and retrieve data from it using Firebase. Additionally, I was able to implement authentication using this technology. I also learned how to create a custom cell for a table view and use a TabBar controller. Through the use of the SDWebImage library, I learned how to fetch images based on the URLs stored in the database.
